evil.css
========

Various subtle and not-so-subtle CSS rules that will drive people nuts.

Inspired by [Upside-Down-Ternet](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html) and [kitgoncharov/evil.js](https://github.com/kitgoncharov/evil.js/tree/).

How to use it
-------------

evil.css is meant to be injected in unsuspecting users' web pages. evil.js was intended to replace hotlinked JavaScript library files, but hotlinking CSS is far less common. Some other ideas:

* Set it as a user stylesheet in a browser (example: discouraging "customers" at Apple Stores from using the computers to browse Facebook and check their email)
* Inject it into pages served to WiFi leachers on your open access point.
* Hack an Internet backbone router and inject it into _everyone's_ web pages.

Obligatory disclaimer
---------------------

evil.css is purely for entertainment purposes. I'm not responsible for anything you do with evil.css, nor do I suggest doing any of the above activities (especially hacking backbone routers).
