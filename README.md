evil.css
========

Various subtle and not-so-subtle CSS rules that will drive people nuts. Inject it into unsuspecting users' webpages.

Inspired by [Upside-Down-Ternet](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html) and [kitgoncharov/evil.js](https://github.com/kitgoncharov/evil.js/tree/).

How to use it
-------------

evil.css is meant to be injected into unsuspecting users' web pages. evil.js was intended to wreak havoc on sites hotlinking JavaScript library files, but hotlinking CSS is far less common. Some other ideas:

* Set it as a user stylesheet in a browser (example: discouraging "customers" at retail stores from using the computers to browse Facebook and check their email)
* Inject it into webpages or CSS files served to WiFi leachers on your open access point.
* Hack an Internet backbone router and inject it into _everyone's_ webpages.

evil.css is purely for entertainment purposes. I'm not responsible for anything you do with evil.css, nor do I suggest doing any of the above activities (especially hacking backbone routers).
